## 4. Object Detection Algorithms

### 4.1 Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
- **Description:**
  - HOG detects object edges and gradients to determine object presence.
  - Effective for objects with smooth edges.
- **Limitations:**
  - Computationally intensive.
  - Ineffective in cluttered or tightly spaced environments.
- **Applications:** Pedestrian detection.

### 4.2 Single Shot Detector (SSD)
- **Description:**
  - Balances speed and accuracy for object detection.
  - Performs single-shot predictions.
- **Limitations:**
  - Reduced resolution impacts small-object detection.
- **Applications:** Detects large objects like furniture, humans, etc.

### 4.3 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- **Description:**
  - Process visual data via convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
  - Core architecture for deep learning models.
- **Advantages:**
  - High accuracy and no human supervision.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Requires substantial training data.
  - Training is time-intensive.
- **Applications:**
  - Widely used in image classification and object detection.

### 4.4 YOLO (You Only Look Once)
- **Description:**
  - Real-time object detection algorithm.
  - Divides the input into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities.
- **Structure:** Built using convolutional layers.
- **Advantages:**
  - Real-time processing.
  - High accuracy with efficient GPU usage.
- **Limitations:**
  - Struggles with very small objects.
  - Does not support tracking.

## 7. Code Implementation

### Explanation of Code
The code demonstrates object detection using YOLOv3, implemented using a deep learning framework. Key steps include:

1. **Importing Libraries:**
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
```

2. **Loading the Pre-trained Model:**
```python
net = cv2.dnn.readNet('yolov3.weights', 'yolov3.cfg')
```

3. **Reading Input Image:**
```python
image = cv2.imread('input.jpg')
```

4. **Preprocessing Image:**
```python
blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(image, 1/255.0, (416, 416), swapRB=True, crop=False)
net.setInput(blob)
```

5. **Detecting Objects:**
```python
layer_names = net.getLayerNames()
out_layers = [layer_names[i[0] - 1] for i in net.getUnconnectedOutLayers()]
outputs = net.forward(out_layers)
```

6. **Processing Outputs:**
- Extract bounding boxes, class IDs, and confidences.
